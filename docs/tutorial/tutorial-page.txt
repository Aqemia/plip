***Input file requirements***
PLIP should work for each structure in valid PDB format. As the tool makes use of OpenBabel for processing the files,
one option to check the validity is to do a simple conversion with OpenBabel using

babel -i pdb <your_file.pdb> -o pdb <any_name.pdb>

If the file can be converted without major errors, it should be ready for use with PLIP. During testing, we have
experienced imcompatibilities when exporting in PDB format from MOE.
